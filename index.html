        Welcome to my planar straight-line graph editor. <br />
        <br />

        Click on empty space to create a point.<br />
        Click on a point to highlight it. A highlighted point has a blue rim.<br />
        While a point is highlighted, click on another point to connect them
        with a line segment.<br />
        To fix a point in place, highlight it and press "f". To undo, do that
        again.<br />

        Points that are immovable are black.<br />

        Press on a line segment to split it.<br />

        To delete a line segment or a point, right-click it. <br />
        <br />
        You can drag points around. <br />
        You can use the arrow keys to navigate and "+" and "-" to zoom. <br /> <br/ >

        
        After editing, the PSLG will be analyzed.<br />

        Points/edges that are part of at least one triangle, non-obtuse angles and non-intersecting edges will be marked green. <br /> 
        <br />
        To view the unanalyzed PSLG (see fixed/movable edges), hold rightclick on empty space
